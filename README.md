### Reflections and Comments
learning web devlopment is very fun, today we took the switch function and i applied it in my (about me project), its like if function but uses cases and breaks. i

i think im doing fine in this course im just a little bit slow, so im taking notes on my notebook so i can refer to it easily.

ive learned a life lesson from coding: "doing a small mistakes can be fatal" :)Â 

mr bashar and the TAs are very helpful and collaborative.

i think i am becoming an adult learner, im not a child anymore :)
